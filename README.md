Take as much time as you need to study what's going on. You don't have to understand every detail, but you are expected to understand the BIG PICTURE of what's going on here. See if you can guess what the various routes are doing and what's happening in each route. When you're done, take a snapshot of your diagram and drop it in your folder (the same folder where you put your build and burns. )
